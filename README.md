# neos-externalRedirect
allow editors to add URIs (absolute or relative) to the neos redirect handler

This is especially useful if you create your site structure from scratch, 
but want to redirect pages from your old site to the matching pages of your new structure.

The URI's can be entered in a new properties field on certain document types.
