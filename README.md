# Neos external redirects
Allows editors to add URIs to the [Neos redirect handler](https://github.com/neos/redirecthandler).

This is especially useful if you create your site structure from scratch, 
but want to redirect pages from your old site to the matching pages of your new structure.

The URI's can be entered in the inspector on nodes of type `Neos.Neos:Document` or other node types using the `ElementareTeilchen.Neos.ExternalRedirect:RedirectUrlsMixin`.
